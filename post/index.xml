      <title>Wayland and Streaming</title>

      <description>Today I was trying to stream some gamplay for my friends from Linux, especifically, from an Arch install on Gnome + Wayland. I ended up throwing too many hours trying to compile OBS.
So I tried to stream at 60 FPS, but no matter what, the streaming/recording was skipping frames.
I assume it could be because of the damn Wayland/Xwayland thing, so I relogin in the X session, try it and it works nicely.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting prepared for what is ahead. I hope this year I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to redo the BackLogger project with a new Rust based backend and a refreshed UI on Flutter.
But thing is, lots of books are also showing up on my TODO list. And on top of that, I just found some amazing web pages for making some exercises to improve my clean code capabilities and my Rust level.</description>
